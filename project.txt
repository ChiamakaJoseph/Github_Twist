what is the significance of "meta charset= UTF-8"
in HTML.

-meta: This is an HTML element used to provide metadata about the HTML document. Metadata is information about the data within the document.
  
-charset: This attribute specifies the character encoding used in the document. Character encoding defines how characters are represented as bytes in the document. UTF-8 is a character encoding that can represent most characters in the Unicode character set.

-UTF-8: UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit) is a variable-width character encoding capable of encoding all possible characters in Unicode. It is widely used on the internet and supports a wide range of languages and scripts.

So, when you include `<meta charset=UTF-8>` in your HTML document, you're specifying that the document should be encoded using UTF-8, which ensures proper display of text in various languages and characters across different platforms and browsers. It's considered best practice to include this meta tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML document to ensure consistent character encoding and prevent potential display issues.
